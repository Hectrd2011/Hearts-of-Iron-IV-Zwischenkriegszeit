In spite of that, Argentina has managed to keep its position among the top 15 economies in the world. With the crisis reaching it's end, it's time we regain the momentum we lost back on 1929.

 ra_ram_ft_mp_sp:0 "Settling Priorities"
 ra_ram_ft_mp_sp_desc:0 "Argentina is large but scarcely populated save for the major urban centers.

 ra_ram_ft_ep_pi:0 "Private Institutions"
 ra_ram_ft_ep_pi_desc:0 "Private Institutions are expensive, but provide better education at no cost for the State. Some may argue that it segregates our children and we’ll have no way to control what is taught in their classrooms; it’s for us to decide if the benefits outweigh the risks."

 ra_ram_ft_ecp_drp_desc:0 "The Roca-Runciman pact was signed in order to ensure our trade with the British held strong after the Great Depression, yet the kneejerk reaction harmed our economy more than helped it. Crippling limits were imposed on our meat exports while Britain interests were granted unfair privileges that have hampered local industries, giving them a monopoly of the market."
 ra_ram_ft_ecp_pdm:0 "Prioritize Domestic Market"
 ra_ram_ft_ecp_pdm_desc:0 "If the British take our produce, then that just means we’ll have to save it for ourselves. It’ll only further our goals of becoming a properly industrialized country."

 ra_ram_ft_ecp_temp_desc:0 "The British are proposing a new agreement and while it’s not particularly great (some may argue it’s worse in certain aspects) there’s no guarantee that we’ll find better offers elsewhere. Still, there are other benefits from keeping healthy trade relations with them."
 ra_ram_ft_ecp_snm:0 "Seek New Markets"
 ra_ram_ft_ecp_snm_desc:0 "Now the constraints of the Roca-Runciman pact are gone we can explore new markets. Germany, the Soviet Union and Japan are great candidates. If we want our trade missions to succeed though, we better make sure we are in good standing with them before sending our delegations."
 ra_ram_ft_ecp_snm_tt: "\nYou'll be able to send one trade mission at a time. It'll take about a month to receive a response.

Now it’s more than a decade later and we still have a long way to go on the road to self-sufficiency. Plans have been drawn up for a new building where we’ll be able to centralize the company’s administration and ensure it runs as smoothly as possible."

 ra_ram_ft_ecp_somisa:0 "SOMISA"
 ra_ram_ft_ecp_somisa_desc:0 "Savio knows that the more we develop our heavy industry the more it'll hunger for steel. Now that the Zapla Foundry and mining site are operational they can provide us the necessary raw materials to enact the National Metallurgy Plan. SOMISA (Sociedad Mixta Siderurgica Argentina) will centralize our steel production industry, bringing it to new heights."

 ra_ram_ft_ecp_ei_desc:0 "Electronic Engineering is a new brand of technology with which our country has little experience. If we want to catch up with this rapidly evolving new branch of science we need to make sure experts and companies with experience in the field feel welcome in Argentina."

 ra_ram_ft_ecp_is:0 "Imports Substitution"
 ra_ram_ft_ecp_is_desc:0 "As countries become more and more protective of their own economies and trade dries up, we are becoming hard pressed in acquiring some manufactured products at reasonable prices. We must find a solution before it becomes a crippling problem."
 ra_ram_ft_ecp_sm:0 "Synthethic Materials"
 ra_ram_ft_ecp_sm_desc:0 "Our industry can build substitutes for pretty much anything, but only if it has the materials required. Even in a country as large as ours, there are things we simply do not have or can't afford to exploit. Our chemist will find ways to replace these."

 ra_ram_ft_fap_dsoi_desc:0 "We must let the world know South America is off limits. We will no longer tolerate their interference neither allow it on our neighbors. We will take onto us the responsibility of upholding peace in this region, whatever costs and whichever the means."
 ra_ram_ft_fap_rpa:0 "Reject Pax Americana"
 ra_ram_ft_fap_rpa_desc:0 "The Monroe Doctrine has been a joke ever since it’s conception. Where were the Americans in 1833 when the British invaded Malvinas? No, this doctrine is just a tool. They show an open friendly hand but hide the big stick of imperialism behind their back with the other."
 ra_ram_ft_fap_i:0 "Interventionism"
 ra_ram_ft_fap_i_desc:0 "Our ideals aren’t just the ideals of the Argentinian people, they are the ideal of every upright and just person in this world. We cannot allow their corruption, not at home nor abroad. We’ll protect them wherever they are threatened."
 ra_ram_ft_fap_pg:0 "Patria Grande"
 ra_ram_ft_fap_pg_desc:0 "Manuel Ugarte popularized the concept in 1922 with his book, yet the idea dates back to the days of Jose de San Martin and Simon Bolivar. The project for unification was drafted yet never signed as there wasn’t a political will behind it. The idea remains however. While it’s hard to conceive such a feat, a united Hispano America, a true Patria Grande could change the world as we know it."
 ra_ram_ft_fap_rin:0 "Regional Integration"
 ra_ram_ft_fap_rin_desc:0 "Our work until now has laid the groundwork for true regional integration with our neighbors. It is now up to them to decide where their future lays."

 rapworks.1.t:0 "New roads!"
 rapworks.1.d:0 "The project to expand our road network in the northern regions of Argentina has finished. Paved and dirt roads now connect all the major population centers in the area and a myriad of smaller rural towns with the rest of the country."
 rapworks.1.a:0 "Excellent."
 #
 rapworks.2.t:0 "New roads!"
 rapworks.2.d:0 "The project to expand our road network in the central regions of Argentina has finished. Paved roads now connect all our major industrial centers with each other, allowing products and resources to move quickly, safely and efficiently across them."
 rapworks.2.a:0 "Excellent."
 #
 rapworks.3.t:0 "New roads!"
 rapworks.3.d:0 "The project to expand our road network in the southern regions of Argentina has finished. We have united the Andes and the Atlantic sea, linked up cities and towns (some of which weren't even in our maps) and expanded the Comodoro Rivadavia port to accomodate larger ships and more cargo."
 rapworks.3.a:0 "Excellent." 
 #
 rapworks.4.t:0 "Comodoro Rivadavia boosts production!"
 rapworks.4.d:0 "After months of work we have finished work on this stage of the Comodoro Rivadavia project, opening new wells, installing machinery and overall improving performance of the entire operation. Oil production has increased considerably. YPF requests we keep funding the project to further improve it's yield."
 rapworks.4.a:0 "Keep funding the project."
 rapworks.4.a.tt:0 "\nOnce works are finished the oil production in Comodoro Rivadavia will increase by 4 and a further +1 per level of Excavation technology you have researched past Excavation I (up to +4).\n"

 rapworks.4.dd.tt:0 "This will fund the Comodor Rivadavia mining project continously without need for your input.\n"
 #
 rapworks.6.t:0 "The Rio Turbio Coal Mine"
 rapworks.6.da:0 "Expanding Rio turbio has been a difficult task. The mine's isolation, the grim history surrounding it (mass executions took place there on the 1920's), the weather, lack of infrastructure, among many other things make the endeavor a risky one. Phase one has seen the first dig site operational but the costs are too high with most of the yield being used in transportation alone. Phase two will see a railway built so we cut costs and reduce the time it takes for the coal to reach our industry."
 rapworks.6.db:0 "Construction has finished on the second dig site of Rio Turbio along with a new railway leading from the mine to it's shipping port on Rio Gallegos. A third dig site is planned and the YCF suggests we expand the port on Rio Gallegos as it's infrastructure is not capable of handling the kind of activity it's being put through, much less once the third site becomes operational."
 rapworks.6.dc:0 "With the third dig site and the improvements to the Rio Gallegos port complete, we can consider the Rio Turbio project complete. Further improvements will require more long term investments, as the location of the mine makes the amount of resources we can pour into it limited."
 rapworks.6.a:0 "Continue on to Phase 2."
 rapworks.6.b:0 "Continue on to Phase 3."
 rapworks.6.c:0 "Excellent, our industry shall hunger no more."
 rapworks.6.d:0 "We can't afford further development of the mine right now."
 rapworks.6.d.tt:0 "You will be asked again in six months."
 rapworks.6.e:0 "We don't need this."

 rapworks.10.a:0 "Excellent."
 #
 rapworks.11.t:0 "The San Carlos Chrome Mine"
 rapworks.11.da:0 "We have chosen the site which showed the most concentration of chrome in the San Carlos area and built the mine and necessary infrastructure to transport the yield. While it's still costly, expanding the operation is worth considering, at least until we find a better source."
 rapworks.11.db:0 "Expansion of the San Carlos chrome mines has been completed. Though it's still possible to tap onto other deposits in the area if we provide the necessary funding."
 rapworks.11.a:0 "Keep funding the project."
 rapworks.11.a.tt:0 "\nOnce works are finished the chrome production in San Carlos will increase by 4 and a further +1 per level of Excavation technology you have researched past Excavation I (up to +4).\n"

 #
 rapworks.13.t:0 "The Cerro Aspero Mine"
 rapworks.13.da:0 "Expansion of the Cerro Aspero mine has been completed. The original digsite, which covers the main vein in the area, has been expanded and the old machinery replaced. An increase in production is already evident, but further funding would allow the mine to tap onto nearby deposits as well."
 rapworks.13.db:0 "Expansion of the Cerro Aspero mining complex has been completed. We have tapped onto new deposits and increased the yield from previous ones. Further expansion is still possible, given the proper funding."
 rapworks.13.a:0 "Keep funding the project."
 rapworks.13.a.tt:0 "\nOnce works are finished the tungsten production in Cerro Aspero will increase by 4 and a further +1 per level of Excavation technology you have researched past Excavation I (up to +4).\n"

 rapworks.15.t:0 "Prospection of the Zapla Forest is done!"
 rapworks.15.d:0 "We have finished our prospection operations of the Zapla forest. Our experts are calling this type of iron 'zaplite', it's a variation of hematite with very similar characteristics to the one found at Thuringia, Germany. While concentrations are just below what's usually needed for an operation to be profitable, our advisors - especially General Savio - insist on it's strategic importance. Until such a time when we can pour more resources into this, we'll improvise a small dig site using the infrastructure built during prospection."

Rodriguez, our Chief of the Army, is supposed to attend yet his health has been delicate in the past months. Rodriguez is too duty bound to request a leave of absence but perhaps we should force him to stay at home for a few weeks in hopes his condition improves."

The sea fleet deployed most of it's units and amazed the attending crowd and officers with a series of coordinated manouvers that even merited compliments by invited foreign dignitaries.\n\nSadly, the day has closed on a grim note: The Chief of the Army, General Manuel Rodriguez - who had attended the event representing his branch of the Armed Forces - died a few hours after the end of the event from a health condition that had haunted him for months. His wife, Emma Fernandez de Rodriguez, survives him though the General did not have any offspring to carry on his legacy."

 ramigration.1.d:0 "Argentina is large but scarceley populated. Our population has grown exponentially in the last decades, yet there are still vast swaths of our territory were we have little or no presence. The time has come to decide where our people can do the most good."
 ramigration.1.a:0 "Encourage urban migration"
 ramigration.1.a_tt:0 "\nSpreading out our population only weakens our industrial efforts, forcing us to commit resources to accommodate small communities that will take decades to bear fruit. People should stick to the major cities, where they’ll be both happier and more productive."
 ramigration.1.b:0 "Populate the countryside"
 ramigration.1.b_tt:0 "\nFor decades our policy has been to encourage migrants to settle in the countryside. Overcrowding could negatively affect our cities in more ways than one. The Great Depression dented our agricultural industry but that doesn’t mean we should abandon it all together."

 ramigration.2.a_tt:0 "\nWhy turn people away when we have room to spare? We must keep growing if we hope to become one of the big players in the world."
 ramigration.2.b:0 "Closed Borders"
 ramigration.2.b_tt:0 "\nYes, we have room to spare. No, we shouldn’t hand a piece of land to every person who crosses our border. It’s time to start vetting those who wish to enter our country."
 #
 ramigration.3.t:0 "Argentina: Land of Opportunity"
 ramigration.3.d:0 "The 'American Dream' is not exclusive to our cousins in the north. Millions of people chose Argentina over the United States to start anew. In order to keep the flow going, we must make sure they know our doors are open and that there's work to be had in our country."
 ramigration.3.a:0 "Regional Inmigration"
 ramigration.3.a_tt:0 "\nMost of our neighbors share history, culture and language with us. Integrating them into our society should be easy. By making it simpler for them to move we’ll be getting more people to plow the fields and man the factories while keeping good relations with nearby countries."

 ramigration.3.b_tt:0 "\nArgentina has its roots in Europe and while we had to fight the old continent for our freedom it doesn’t mean we shouldn’t welcome its people (as long as they leave their colonialist ideas behind). The more the merrier and if some of them provide our industry with skilled labor, even better."
 ramigration.3.c:0 "Safe-Heaven Initiative"
 ramigration.3.c_tt:0 "\nNot every migrant leaves his home in search of greener grass or a new beginning. Some are forced, through violence or fear, it doesn’t matter. Argentina might have a history of political unrest, but is nonetheless a peaceful country. Welcoming refugees will tax us… but never break us. If anything, it can only make us stronger in the long run.\n\nThis idea will be lost if your country enters a war or causes more than 15% world tension."

 #
 ramigration.8.t:0 "Directive 11 is Revoked"
 ramigration.8.d:0 "As promised during their campaign, the new government rushed congress to get Directive 11 revoked. As much as they'd like to set it as an example of how differently they intend to run the country, those with good memory haven't failed to notice many of those now cheering are the same who helped pass the law in the first place.\n\nPolitics aside, today marks the end of Directive 11... for now."

Opinions are evenly split between those who think the Treaty could become a hindrace to our own goals and those who think it's an extra layer of protection against an increasingly dangerous world. Article 17 of the treaty states any party wishing to withdraw must give a year notice... a lot can happen in that time though."

Our country can't afford the cost of life entailed with Great War tactics nor the economical pressure of long winded conflicts. A new doctrine has emerged, first seen on the Polish-Soviet War of 1919. Generals across Europe are experimenting with it and it won't be long before the way wars are waged is changed completely."

His understanding of armored vehicles is commendable, specially considering our country's lack of experience with them. With the right budget backing him, there's no telling what could come from his ingenuity."

 genius_aircraft_designer_th_desc:0 "Arteaga's military career had a brilliant start. He received wide praise from his teachers and superiors, both in Argentina and France, where he specialized in artillery. In 1916 he filed for retirement, much to the army's dismay, however this was just the start of a new stage in his life. Lured by aeronautics, Arteaga moved to Paris in 1916 so he could study that new technology first hand. He joined the Superior School of Aeronautics and Mechanical Construction of Paris, graduating as aeronautical engineer in 1918 and becoming the first Argentinian with that specialty. Arteaga remained in Europe for two more years, learning as much as he can. He returned to Argentina in 1922, filled with theoretical and practical knowledge. In 1925 he presented his proyect for an Airplane Factory in Argentinian soil, which was quickly approved and put into motion. The FMA opened it's doors on 1927, less than a year later Argentina had already built it's first Biplane Avro K-504 'Gosport'. Arteaga thinks we need not rely on liscensed models though, favoring the idea of creating our own."
